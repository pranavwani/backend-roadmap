# üß† Backend Developer Roadmap (Visual + Checklist)

---

## ‚úÖ 1. Language Mastery (Node.js + optionally Go)
- [ ] Async/await, Promises // Master handling asynchronous flows and responses.
- [ ] Event loop & concurrency // Understand how tasks are queued and executed non-blockingly.
- [ ] Error handling // Catch and propagate errors without crashing the server.
- [ ] Streams & buffers // Process data piece-by-piece for performance.
- [ ] Worker threads // Offload heavy CPU tasks from the main event loop.

---

## üåê 2. HTTP & Networking Basics
- [ ] HTTP verbs, status codes // Learn CRUD patterns and appropriate response codes.
- [ ] Headers, cookies, CORS // Manage request metadata and cross-origin policies.
- [ ] HTTPS / TLS basics // Ensure secure communication.
- [ ] REST vs GraphQL // Choose between structured vs flexible APIs.
- [ ] WebSocket fundamentals // Implement bi-directional communication for real-time apps.

---

## üì¶ 3. API Design
- [ ] RESTful routes & versioning // Structure endpoints logically and future-proof APIs.
- [ ] OpenAPI / Swagger docs // Auto-generate and share API documentation.
- [ ] Pagination, filtering, sorting // Efficiently return and navigate large datasets.
- [ ] Rate limiting // Prevent abuse by throttling excessive requests.
- [ ] Authentication (JWT, OAuth2) // Secure and validate user sessions and permissions.

---

## üõ¢Ô∏è 4. Databases
- [ ] SQL basics (SELECT, JOIN, INDEX) // Write efficient relational queries.
- [ ] NoSQL (MongoDB, Redis) // Work with unstructured or key-value data.
- [ ] ORMs (Prisma/Sequelize) // Simplify and abstract database access.
- [ ] Database migrations // Apply and track schema changes safely.
- [ ] Connection pooling // Optimize resource use under load.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 5. Async Processing & Queues
- [ ] EventEmitter usage // Trigger and listen for local events.
- [ ] Bull.js / Redis queues // Schedule and retry background jobs.
- [ ] Background jobs with workers // Run long tasks without blocking APIs.
- [ ] Retry & dead-letter queues // Handle failures and escalations.
- [ ] CRON job scheduling // Automate recurring server-side tasks.

---

## üß± 6. System Design Principles
- [ ] Stateless servers // Design horizontally scalable apps.
- [ ] Load balancing // Distribute requests across services.
- [ ] Caching (Redis, CDN) // Store frequent data closer to the client.
- [ ] Horizontal scaling // Duplicate instances to handle load.
- [ ] CAP theorem understanding // Balance consistency, availability, and partition tolerance.

---

## üîê 7. Security Essentials
- [ ] Input validation // Sanitize inputs to prevent injection.
- [ ] Hashing passwords (bcrypt, argon2) // Store credentials securely.
- [ ] CORS & CSRF // Enforce cross-origin rules and prevent forgery attacks.
- [ ] HTTPS setup // Encrypt traffic between client and server.
- [ ] Role-based access control // Limit functionality based on user roles.

---

## üß™ 8. Testing & Debugging
- [ ] Unit tests (Jest) // Validate small code blocks.
- [ ] Integration tests (Supertest) // Test components working together.
- [ ] API mocking // Simulate dependent services during testing.
- [ ] Debugging with logs/breakpoints // Trace and inspect code during runtime.
- [ ] Test coverage // Measure what‚Äôs tested and what‚Äôs not.

---

## üìä 9. Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Logging with Winston or Pino // Track runtime behavior and errors.
- [ ] PM2 process monitoring // Restart crashed services and view status.
- [ ] Metrics (Prometheus + Grafana) // Analyze performance and health.
- [ ] Error tracking (Sentry) // Capture and alert on exceptions.
- [ ] Log rotation & retention // Manage log file size and history.

---

## üöÄ 10. Deployment & DevOps
- [ ] Dockerize app // Package app and dependencies for any environment.
- [ ] .env file management // Securely manage environment-specific config.
- [ ] CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions) // Automate testing and deployment.
- [ ] Reverse proxy (Nginx) // Route traffic, handle SSL, and load balancing.
- [ ] Domain, SSL, HTTPS // Finalize secure public access.

---

# üõ†Ô∏è Project Checklist: "Real-Time Task Manager API"

### Phase 1: Basic REST API
- [ ] Create users, projects, tasks // Define and seed primary data models.
- [ ] Authentication (JWT) // Issue and validate tokens.
- [ ] CRUD routes for each model // Enable full data lifecycle.
- [ ] Role-based access (admin/user) // Enforce permissions on routes.

### Phase 2: Real-Time Events
- [ ] Use `EventEmitter` to emit `taskUpdated`, `taskAssigned` // Trigger internal events on changes.
- [ ] Add WebSocket layer with `socket.io` // Enable persistent client-server connection.
- [ ] Broadcast real-time updates // Notify users when data changes.

### Phase 3: Async Processing
- [ ] Add background job to send email on task assign // Decouple heavy I/O from request.
- [ ] Use BullMQ + Redis queue // Queue jobs with retries.
- [ ] Add retry logic and status logs // Track failed jobs and retry history.

### Phase 4: Monitoring & Metrics
- [ ] Integrate PM2 + logging // Auto-restart app and capture logs.
- [ ] Collect metrics (requests/sec, memory, failures) // Track usage and errors.
- [ ] View dashboards with Grafana // Visualize key system metrics.

### Phase 5: Docker + CI/CD
- [ ] Add Dockerfile & docker-compose.yml // Containerize the full stack.
- [ ] Use GitHub Actions to lint/test/deploy // Automate build and push pipeline.
- [ ] Deploy to Render/Vercel/Fly.io // Push to a real-world host.
